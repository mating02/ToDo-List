# ToDo-List
Here, i create a To-do list website in which the user can structure his plans for the day. For this project, I am going to use tailwind css, webpack and ES6 modules to structure and bundle my code.
Check out the Live: https://mating02.github.io/ToDo-List/

The todo list has a lot of useful options that are available via interactive SVGs. This involves:
 - adding to do dos via the plus button
 - removing To Dos
 - marking a todo as important
 - showing the details of a todo
 - adding projects that can each have its own todo list
 - dynamically adding the todos to the days at which they have to be done
 - saving user input via localStorage API
